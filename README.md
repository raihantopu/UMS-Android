# UMS-Android
## University Management System (Android) - simple and user friendly version of University Management System (UMS).

This app includes features like (view student profile, view result report, view attendence report, pay fees, and download admit card).
This app communicate with backend via REST API used in web application University Management System (https://github.com/raihantopu/university-management-system), no hard coded values are used. This app is installable on phone But will not work directly (fetching data from server) cause no real URL or IP are used. This app tested only on local environment or local server / development server. No authenticaton is used in this app so while communicating with backend you may face trouble.
